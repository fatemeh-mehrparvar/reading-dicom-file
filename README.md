DICOM Image Format is an international standard to transmit, store, retrieve, print, process, and display medical imaging information. DICOM allows transmitting medical imaging data to devices like scanners, servers, workstations, printers, network hardware, and PACS. Before DICOM, radiologists relied on two-dimensional film scans and physically stored them inside film jackets. Technology advancements in this realm brought about change resulting in convenience, cost-savings, and better patient care. This standard has revolutionized the radiology industry, encompassing many imaging modalities such as X-rays, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasound, nuclear medicine, PET scans, etc.

Practicioners may have heard of the DICOM image format in radiology or need clarification on what it is and why itâ€™s so important. In this blog article, we will explain the fundamentals of DICOM technology, its impact on clinical practice and radiology workflows, and dig deeper into enhanced functionality offered by modern PACS systems.
